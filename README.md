# Project-Euler

WARNING: Project Euler isn't a "competition" website. They've explicitly stated the point is to solve the problems on your own, without the assistance of hints or solutions to their problems, in order to test your own critical thinking and understanding. Don't look at this code if you plan on adhering to their philosophy.

This is my space for practicing problems on www.projecteuler.net. Main problems are broken out into several versions I've used for test code. Look at the last version number for each main problem number to see my final code.
